# ReactZapIntegration Workflow Guide

## Overview
The `ReactZapIntegration` class is responsible for integrating React-based components, such as the `PostmanInterface`, into the VS Code contrib module. It ensures that the React components are dynamically imported, mounted, and unmounted correctly, while also handling data changes and HTTP requests.

## React Component Integration

### Mounting Logic
1. **Dynamic Import**: The `PostmanInterface` component is dynamically imported from the built output (`src2/`).
2. **Cleanup**: Before mounting a new React root, any existing React root is cleaned up using the `cleanup` method.
3. **Service Accessor**: A custom service accessor is created to provide required services to the React component.
4. **Mounting**: The `mountPostmanInterface` function is called with the container, service accessor, and props (e.g., `zapData`, `onDataChange`, `onSendRequest`).
5. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during mounting, a fallback error message is displayed in the container.

### Unmounting Logic
- The `cleanup` method disposes of the React root and resets it to `null`.

## Styling Guidelines

### Tailwind Utility Classes
- All components in `src/` should use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
- Tailwind classes are transformed into `void-` prefixed classes during the build process.

### Central Stylesheet
- Import `styles.css` in components to ensure consistent styling across the contrib module.
- Avoid relying on custom CSS files like `postman.css`. Migrate any necessary styles to Tailwind or utilities.

## Build and Watch Process

### Build Output
- The build process compiles components from `src/` to `src2/`.
- Ensure that the latest build output reflects the updated Tailwind-based styles.

### Watch Process
- Use the `watch-clientd` and `watchreactd` tasks to monitor changes and rebuild components automatically.

## Error Handling

### During Rendering
- Errors during the rendering process are caught and logged.
- A fallback error message is displayed in the container to inform the user.

### HTTP Request Errors
- Errors during HTTP requests are caught and rethrown with a descriptive message.

## Future Considerations

### Custom CSS
- Decide whether to fully migrate all styles to Tailwind or retain some custom CSS for advanced cases.
- If `postman.css` is no longer needed, remove it to simplify the codebase.

### Documentation
- Keep this document updated as the integration evolves.
- Add examples and edge cases to help future developers understand the workflow.

### Testing
- Ensure thorough testing of the React component integration, including edge cases and error scenarios.
